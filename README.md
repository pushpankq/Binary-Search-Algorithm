# Binary-Search-Algorithm


Time Complexity:- 

how many times can you divide N by 2 until you have 1? This is essentially saying, do a binary search (half the elements) until you found it. In a formula this would be this:

1 = N / 2x

multiply by 2x:

2x = N

now do the log2:

log2(2x)    = log2 N
x * log2(2) = log2 N
x * 1         = log2 N
